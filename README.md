Technical Task: Marvel App

I used:
1- 'dio' Package for http requstes
2- 'convert' & 'crypto' packages for genereting MD5 String to access api of Marvel.

I tried to work this task only by materials widgets and not using out source packages for anything. 

Thank You for this opportunity,

Best Regarts,
